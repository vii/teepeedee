* document options
* performance test
* fix sendfile

* poll on linux takes at least one jiffy, so max rate with 64 KB buffers is 64 KB * HZ
	- to solve this bottleneck could use mmap (but the address space is limited)
	- could use varying buffer sizes
* ssl does not need a separate buffer
* http content-range resume
* generally make more http spec compliant

* http name based virtual hosts
* test harder
* safely bind to privileged ports

* smp optimization
* maybe add realpath checking
* do something about brute force password attacks
* add rate limiting
* catch out of memory conditions
* reduce the number of stat syscalls
* conftree cache?
* IPv6
* implement ftp STAT properly
* implement ftp OPTS
* implement ftp ssl PROT
* fix ftp REIN to close ssl connection
